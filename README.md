# bpl_prediction

Scripts and Code for our Semester Project. We try to predict the outcome of the games using 2 methods :
 1) using a Poisson Law
 2) using Tweets 
This is only a start for the moment because many things cannot be taken into account with a basic Poisson Law
and we're working on improving our model.
